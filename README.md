# jijingBetaBot
Jijing Beta Discord Bot.

A basic form of Jijing. 

Over time, more features and optimizations will be added.
Mainly, I'll be adding features from my other bots into this one.
For customization or to request features, you can DM me on Twitter [@BlueM1ST](https://twitter.com/BlueM1ST)

# Features
Host a beta on your Discord server!

Jijing is designed to work on public Discord servers, so you don't need to make a new server to run your beta.

It is designed for games (I use it mainly for VNs and RPGs), so what better platform to use than the gaming social media program Discord? However, it will work for most beta projects with a bit of customization.

# Setup

Other than actually setting up the bot, there are a few things that will need to be set up on the Discord server.

Your Discord server will need some new channels:
- A buglist channel
- a testing channel
- a general channel
- an admin channel

The names given to these don't matter. You will also need their channel IDs.

You will also need some new roles:
- Beta Group
- Admin_like
- Admin

These are the minimum to hold one beta (Jijing can host multiple betas if new roles are set).

# TODO

Some features that I plan on adding:
- Better access to the report database
- Printing a set number of reports on the buglist
- Easier customization
- Adding a login file
- Auto-moderation
- Anti-spam
